# Machine Learning Challenge
### Utilzed 3 different models: 

1. Using Logistic Regretion (Model saved as classifier_model.sav)

    My findings were: 

        Training Data Score: 0.88670608430288

        Testing Data Score: 0.897025171624714  


2. Using KNN Classifier (Model saved as knn_model.sav)

        Training Data Score: 0.8363844393592678
    
        Testing Data Score: 0.8363844393592678

3. Using RandomForrest Classifier (Model saved as rf_model.sav)

        Training Data Score: 1.0

        Testing Data Score: 0.9096109839816934


### Conclusion: 

Overall my best model was the Random Forest Classifier which produce a 1.0 in the training data.
